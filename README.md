<p>This code does take as an input the topic of a fairy tale and number of pages.<br><br>It than prompts the openai API with a request to write a n paragraph text, based on the user's input. This text is cached into an array and the programm sends one more prompt to make the conclusion out of each paragraph. <br><br>During the use of API there is a bit of loading so b e patience <br><br> Images are generated dynamically as the user progresses though the fairy tale. This is done to minimise the loading time.<br><br> The page number zero is a book cover</p>
